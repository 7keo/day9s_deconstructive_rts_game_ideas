\[speaking about Frost Giant]

*I actually hope that the RTS is so abstract in execution it's hard to tell even what it is.
Like I'm talking, the resources you collect are right clicks, ok? That's the resource.
Screw minerals and gas. It's right clicks, ok?
So instead of minerals and gas, it's right clicks and box selects, ok?
Like "Oh shit, I don't have any more box selects, so I can't pick any units!", like how-- I want dumb dumb dumb shit,Ok?
Alright, you know, what else could we have?*

\[...]

*You know, I actually was talking to a friend, this was along time ago, this was like 2009, about the idea of when you have a competitive game.
In a lot of games, you have the narrative layer that gets you into it, and often the narrative layer that inspires the developres.
For instance, Age Of Empires, that I have been watching so so so fucking much, right?
Age Of Empires, clearly was inspired by "how does an ancient civilization grow?", it's not called "Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3", it's called "The Dark Age", and "The Feudal Age", and "The Castle Age", and "The Imperial Age". It's structured in this is "agey" kind of way, right?
And same thing with Brood War, you know, Brood War the entire structure of "we're the zerg, the insect-style race" - "Oh, what would that be like? Let me try to think through and explore, you know, what a zerg-y race might have looked like, or more insectoid race", ok.
So this inspiration point can often generate interesting cool gameplay. Like "oh, the creep, they're sort of expanding their gack of influence everywhere" - quote me on that.
But what ends up happening in a lot of competitive games, is players quickly look past what the narrative is, and they get obsessed with what the gameplay is, and the success points of the gameplay.
So for instance, APM, multitasking, management, never stop building workers, you know these sorts of things.
Never stop building workers feels like a rhythm game when you play an RTS.
It feels like build a worker, and then 30s go by build another worker, and then 30s build a worker, then your marines every 15s. Build a marine, build a marine, build a worker, build a marine. Right?
You kinda get this cadence going that's very much so about the interactive medium, much less about this sort of flavor of what is going on. Much less about the narrative flavor of what's going on.
And so the conversation I was having with my buddy way long ago was, what if after in some genre the players learned what the gameplay was about and how all that shit function.*

\[...]

*And so the statement is what if you took something like Starcraft and found out that it was about APM and rhythm management, something like that, and just made a game that was that on the surface.
Just absolutely bluntly about that shit.
And to me this is a hilarious idea, right?
You make a fighting game where you don't even have a character that punches and kick, you have little rhythm combos that show up, and you're trying to out-rhythm each other, and it's just gage management. That's the sort of shit I'm into, right?
So instead of workers that are collecting money, [you have] workers that are collecting right clicks, that are collecting box selects.*

*I was talking to a friend of mine long ago when I was in grad school, about a game that is literally pure abstraction. Think of like a real time strategy game, where you don't collect minerals, you collect right clicks, rights? So if you run out of right clicks you can no longer tell any of your units to target fire. And the other resource is box selects.*

*The idea is, you make a game that is really taking stuff to literally, or being kinda weird and abstract in its construction.
The example I was using was an RTS game in which the resources you collect are left and right clicks. And when you climb up the tech tree what you do is you unlock buttons.
So you're just like "Oh man, I'm really excited, I'm gonna unlock attack-move layer", stuff like this.
You unlock the "A", unlock the "S" button, stuff like this.
I'm interested in this sort of thing.
And I want, your idea for a game. It's like "Baba Is You", is a pretty good example of like, it's actually one of the best examples of both an interesting deconstruction logically, and wtf \(be going on)\[?].*

\[...]

*And there's small bits (of this in) games, that I find really interesting. Like, ok, in Starcraft you just have a minimap. But in the original Command & Conquer game, you had to build the "Communication Center" to get your minimap.*

\[...]

*Yeah, like there's things about the mechanics that really self referencial, or abstract, or weird. Or like a platformer, where you have a limited number of jumps, and you're collecting jumps as a resource. And I don't know what the name of this sort of thing is. I'm thinking of making this the next game jam that our community does at the end of the year.*

*Inconvenience and problems is where fun comes from fro humans.*

\[...]

*I'm interested in doing something kinda like a bizarre anti deconstruction of game.
Like a game that has an interface that is just so convoluted and difficult, that the game is making the character do something really basic, but the basic actions are way too fucking complicated.*

\[...]

*You know, the version I talked about was an RTS where instead of collecting minerals and gas, instead you collect left clicks and right clicks.
And the tech tree is unlocking buttons. Like you can't attack-move, until you've unlocked "A", you know what I mean?*
